It is recommended to place the locale provider at the top level of the application. 
The whole list of supported locales can be found https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/tree/master/components/locale-provider[here].

To add a new language, please refer to https://ant.design/components/locale-provider/#Add-a-new-language[this].

===== Moment.js
Some Ant Design components (eg: `calendar`, `date-picker`,
`date-picker-range-picker`) uses the Moment.js to display 
the dates in the correct language.

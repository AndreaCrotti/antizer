It is recommended to place the locale provider at the top level of the application.
The whole list of supported locales can be found https://ant.design/docs/react/i18n#LocaleProvider[here].

To add a new language, please refer to https://ant.design/components/locale-provider/#Add-a-new-language[this].

===== Moment.js
Some Ant Design components (eg: `calendar`, `date-picker`,
`date-picker-range-picker`) uses the Moment.js library to display
the dates in the correct language.
